## About the Video Course
Kotlin greatly reduces source code verbosity. With Google having announced its support for Kotlin as a first-class language for writing Android apps, now's the time to learn how to create apps from scratch with Kotlin

The Applied Kotlin for Android Application Development course is for developers who have some experience in the basics of Kotlin and are ready to take the plunge into the more advanced stage. This course covers Kotlin's superpowers, as it were. You should already know the syntax, but now we will go over the things that make Kotlin stand out—such as inline functions and null safety.You will learn about Anko, a Kotlin library which makes Android application development faster and easier. It makes your code clean and easy to read and smoothes out the rough edges in the Android SDK for Java. You will also publish the app you built during the course to get an overall end-to-end experience of Kotlin Android application development.

By the end of this course, you will have gained experience in creating and deploying Android applications using Kotlin.
